      I currently live in the west metro Atlanta, Ga area, where I grew up as a
      child. I am married to my wife of over 20 years, and we have three
      adult-ish children. I transitioned to a career in application development
      after spending more than two decades in business management and sales
      related roles. I hold a Masterâ€™s degree in business administration and
      learned to build web applications through self-study. I spend most of my
      free time grilling, trying new restaurants with my wife or just hanging
      out with my Great Dane Lynyrd. I also enjoy getting tortured by watching
      Georgia sports teams continually falling short of winning championships.
